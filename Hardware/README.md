# Hardware

## Overview

This board is solar powered and has an ATmega1284p. It has two Input Capture (ICP1, ICP3) hardware units which each connect to an inverting open collector transistor that pulls down the respective ICP pin when current (e.g. >7mA) is flowing through a 100 Ohm sense resistor. The captured value is accurate to within one crystal (30ppm + drift) count of the pulse edge that caused the event. This captured value may for example be data acquisition of the rotating trubine in a flow meter. The board also has six digital interfaces with voltage level conversion, and four analog inputs each with current sources for current loops. The ATmega1284p can be programmed with the AVR toolchain on Debian, Ubuntu, Raspbian, and others. The toolchain is also available with the Arduino IDE, and PlatformIO.

Bootloader options include [optiboot] and [xboot]. Uploading through a bootloader eliminates fuse setting errors and there are few register settings that can block an upload accidentally (some other bootloaders don't clear the watchdog and can get stuck in a loop). This has given the feel of robustness during my software development experience.

# Assembly

## SMD

The board is assembled with CHIPQUIK no-clean solder SMD291AX (RoHS non-compliant). 

The SMD reflow is done in a Black & Decker Model NO. TO1303SB which has the heating elements controlled by a Solid State Relay and an ATMega328p loaded with this [Reflow] firmware.

## 100k Ohm Thermistor

The LT3652 has a control loop for regulating the input voltage, which can be compensated to track the maximum power point of silicon photovoltaic string (36 cell's in this case). The power point of a silicon PV cell is well known and so is the amount it changes with temperature, so compensation is possible.

Another control loop in the LT3652 is for regulating the SLA voltage, which needs to be compensated so that the charging voltage tracks with temperature to prevent battery damage.

Both are compensated with a 100k Thermistor which is placed on a short wire mounted in heat shrink with some thermoplastic and connected to the pluggable screw terminals. When in use the installer will need to place a sensor under the PV panel and the other sensor near the battery. Use a sunlight resistant cable between the PV panel and the enclosure, and for the battery temperature sensor use wiring appropriate for the enclosure. These sensors should be wired with twisted pair to minimize injecting noise into the charge controller.
