# Self-Test

## Overview

Check Irrigate7 Board Functions, runs once after a reset and then loops in a do noting section.

For a quick idea of what is going on lets look at R1 (47 Ohm) which has three 20mA current sources (22mA@DIO10, 22mA@ADC1, 22mA@ADC0) feeding into it, and is measured with ADC0. The 22mA@DIO10 digital current source connects to DIO13 befor going through a string of red LED that feed into the R1 resistor. When DIO13 sinks the current its voltage will be about 4V at the plug which should not bias the LED's.

Note: I am concerned the level shift could somewhat turn on with the 4V drop on the DIO protection resistor and that would cause problems.

The red and green LED are used to indicate test status.

## Wiring Needed for RPUno

![Wiring](./Setup/SelfTestWiring.png)

## Battery

Connect a fairly large 12V SLA battery and a 100k Ohm resistor to the battery thermistor input. The test looks for an MPPT voltage so the battery should be less than the float voltage. 

The battery needs to charge to 13.1V before the VIN that powers MCU will connect. A large battery will give sufficient time to load the firmware and run a test before the float voltage is reached and the MPPT mode terminates.

## Power Supply

Connect a power supply with CV and CC mode. Set CC at 150mA then increase CV to 21V. The charge controler will turn on and regulate the input voltage at its MPPT (assuming the battery is not at its float voltage). 

Note: I adjust CC to speed up charging until VIN connects and then return it to the 150mA setting.

## Firmware Upload

With a serial port connection (set the BOOT_PORT in Makefile) and optiboot installed on the RPUno run 'make bootload' and it should compile and then flash the MCU.

``` 
rsutherland@conversion:~/Samba/RPUno/SelfTest$ make bootload
...
avrdude done.  Thank you.
rsutherland@conversion:~/Samba/Irrigate7/SelfTest$ make clean
rm -f SelfTest.hex SelfTest.map
``` 

Now connect with picocom (exit is C-a, C-x). 

```
rsutherland@conversion:~/Samba/Irrigate7/SelfTest$ picocom -b 38400 /dev/ttyUSB0
